### 2.1. Getting a Git Repository

Typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways:
1. You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository
2. You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere.

#### 2.1.1 Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory
First need to go to that projectâ€™s directory and type
    
    $ git init

If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few git add commands that specify the files you want to track followed by a git commit:

    $ git add *.c
    $ git add LICENSE
    $ git commit -m 'Initial project version'

#### 2.1.2 Cloning an Existing Repository

You clone a repository with git clone <url>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable
library called demogit, you can do so like this(gitpro is github username):

    $ git clone https://github.com/gitpro/demogit

If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than demogit, you can
specify the new directory name as an additional argument:

    $ git clone https://github.com/gitpro/demogit mygit

That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called mygit.
