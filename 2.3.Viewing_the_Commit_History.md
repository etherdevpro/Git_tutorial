### 2.3. Viewing the Commit History
#### 2.3.1. Basic, Common Option, Specifier
The most basic and powerful tool to do this is the git log command.

    $ git log

if you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the --stat option:

    $ git log --stat

Another really useful option is --pretty.
This option changes the log output to formats other than the default. A few prebuilt option values are available for you to use.
The most interesting option value is format, which allows you to specify your own log output format.

    $ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"

Useful specifiers for git log --pretty=format lists some of the more useful specifiers that format takes.

_Table 1. Useful specifiers for git log --pretty=format_
| Specifier | Description of Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| %H | Commit hash |
| %h | Abbreviated commit hash |
| %T | Tree hash |
| %t | Abbreviated tree hash |
| %P | Parent hashes |
| %p | Abbreviated parent hashes |
| %an | Author name |
| %ae | Author email |
| %ad | Author date (format respects the --date=option) |
| %ar | Author date, relative |
| %cn | Committer name |
| %ce | Committer email |
| %cd | Committer date |
| %cr | Committer date, relative |
| %s | Subject |

Those are only some simple output-formatting options to git log — there are many more. Common options to git log lists the options we’ve covered so far, as well as some other common formatting options that may be useful, along with how they change the output of the log command.

_Table 2. Common options to git log_
| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| -p | Show the patch introduced with each commit. |
| --stat | Show statistics for files modified in each commit. |
| --shortstat | Display only the changed/insertions/deletions line from the --stat command. |
| --name-only | Show the list of files modified after the commit information. |
| --name-status | Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well. |
| --abbrev-commit | Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40. |
| --relative-date | Display the date in a relative format (for example, “2 weeks ago”) instead of using the full date format. |
| --graph | Display an ASCII graph of the branch and merge history beside the log output. |
| --pretty | Show commits in an alternate format. Option values include oneline, short, full, fuller, and format (where you specify your own format). |
| --oneline | Shorthand for --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit used together. |

#### 2.3.2 Limiting Log Output

    $ git log --since=2.weeks

_Table 3. Options to limit the output of git log_
| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| -\<n> | Show only the last n commits. |
| --since, --after | Limit the commits to those made after the specified date. |
| --until, --before | Limit the commits to those made before the specified date. |
| --author | Only show commits in which the author entry matches the specified string. |
| --committer | Only show commits in which the committer entry matches the specified string. |
| --grep | Only show commits with a commit message containing the string. |
| -S | Only show commits adding or removing code matching the string. |
