### 2.2 Recording Changes to the Repository

#### 2.2.1 Checking the Status of Your Files
command is:

    $ git status

#### 2.2.2 Tracking New Files
In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command git add. To begin tracking the README file, you can run this:

    $ git add README

#### 2.2.3 Staging Modified Files

Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` and then run your git status command again, you get something that looks like this:
```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
new file: README
Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
```

Let’s run git add now to stage the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, and then run git status again:
```
$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
new file: README
modified: CONTRIBUTING.md
```

#### 2.2.4 Short Status

If you run git status -s or git status --short you get a far more simplified output from the command:
```
$ git status -s
M README
MM Rakefile
A lib/git.rb
M lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt
```
#### 2.2.5 Ignoring Files
Here is example .gitignore file:
```
# ignore all .a files
*.a
# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a
# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO
# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/
# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt
# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
```
#### 2.2.6 Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes

To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged, type git diff with no other arguments:

    $ git diff

If you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use git diff --staged.

    $ git diff --staged

#### 2.2.7 Commit your changes
The simplest way to commit is to type git commit:

    git commit

Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the commit command by specifying it after a -m flag, like this:

    $ git commit -m "fix numbering issues"

#### 2.2.8 Removing Files

This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your .gitignore file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of .a compiled files. To do this, use the --cached option:

    $ git rm --cached README

You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the git rm command. That means you can do
things such as:

    $ git rm log/\*.log

Note the backslash (\) in front of the *. This is necessary because Git does its own filename
expansion in addition to your shell’s filename expansion. This command removes all files that have
the .log extension in the log/ directory. Or, you can do something like this:

    $ git rm \*~

This command removes all files whose names end with a ~.

#### 2.2.9 Moving Files
If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:

    $ git mv file_from file_to

However, this is equivalent to running something like this:

    $ mv README.md README
    $ git rm README.md
    $ git add README
