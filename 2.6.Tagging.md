### 2.6. Tagging
#### 2.6.1 Listing Your Tags
Listing the existing tags in Git is straightforward. Just type git tag (with optional -l or --list):

    $ git tag 
    
If you’re interested only in looking at the 1.8.5 series, you can run this:

    $ git tag -l "v1.8.5*"

#### 2.6.2 Creating Tags
Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated.

##### 2.6.2.1 Annotated Tags
Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple. The easiest way is to specify -a when you run the tag command:

    $ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"

##### 2.6.2.2 Lightweight Tags

This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file — no other information is kept. To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply any of the -a, -s, or -m options, just provide a tag name:

    $ git tag v1.4-lw

#### 2.6.3 Tagging Later

You can also tag commits after you’ve moved past them.

    $ git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02

#### 2.6.4 Sharing Tags

By default, the git push command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers. You will have to explicitly push tags to a shared server after you have created them. This process is just like sharing remote branches — you can run git push origin \<tagname>.

    $ git push origin v1.5

#### 2.6.5 Deleting Tags

To delete a tag on your local repository, you can use git tag -d <tagname>. For example, we could remove our lightweight tag above as follows:

    $ git tag -d v1.4-lw

Note that this does not remove the tag from any remote servers. There are two common variations for deleting a tag from a remote server.

- The first variation is git push \<remote> :refs/tags/\<tagname>:

    $ git push origin :refs/tags/v1.4-lw

- The second (and more intuitive) way to delete a remote tag is with:

    $ git push origin --delete <tagname>

#### 2.6.6 Checking out Tags

If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a git checkout of that tag, although this puts your repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects:

    $ git checkout v2.0.0

If you need to make changes — say you’re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance — you will generally want to create a branch:

    $ git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
