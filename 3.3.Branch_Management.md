### 3.3 Branch Management
The git branch command does more than just create and delete branches. If you run it with no arguments, you get a simple listing of your current branches:
```
$ git branch
iss53
* master
testing
```
To see the last commit on each branch, you can run git branch -v:

    $ git branch -v

#### 3.3.1 Changing a branch name

Rename the branch locally with the git branch --move command:

    $ git branch --move bad-branch-name corrected-branch-name

This replaces your bad-branch-name with corrected-branch-name, but this change is only local for now. To let others see the corrected branch on the remote, push it:

    $ git push --set-upstream origin corrected-branch-name

#### 3.3.2 Changing the master branch name

Rename your local master branch into main with the following command:

    $ git branch --move master main
    $ git push --set-upstream origin main

Now you have a few more tasks in front of you to complete the transition:
- Any projects that depend on this one will need to update their code and/or configuration.
- Update any test-runner configuration files.
- Adjust build and release scripts.
- Redirect settings on your repo host for things like the repo’s default branch, merge rules, and other things that match branch names.
- Update references to the old branch in documentation.
- Close or merge any pull requests that target the old branch.

After you’ve done all these tasks, and are certain the main branch performs just as the master branch, you can delete the master branch:

    $ git push origin --delete master
