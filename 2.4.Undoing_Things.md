### 2.4. Undoing Things

If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the --amend option:

    $ git commit --amend

#### 2.4.1 Unstaging a Staged File

use git reset HEAD \<file>… to unstage.

    $ git reset HEAD CONTRIBUTING.md

#### 2.4.2 Unmodifying a Modified File

    git checkout -- <file>

It’s important to understand that git checkout -- <file> is a dangerous command. Any local changes you made to that file are gone — Git just replaced that file with the last staged or committed version. Don’t ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don’t want those unsaved local changes.

#### 2.4.3 Undoing things with git restore

Git version 2.23.0 introduced a new command: git restore. It’s basically an alternative to git reset which we just covered. From Git version 2.23.0 onwards, Git will use git restore instead of git reset for many undo operations.

##### 2.4.3.1 Unstaging a Staged File with git restore

Right below the “Changes to be committed” text, it says use git restore --staged \<file>… to unstage.

    $ git restore --staged CONTRIBUTING.md

##### 2.4.3.2 Unmodifying a Modified File with git restore

    $ git restore CONTRIBUTING.md

It’s important to understand that git restore <file> is a dangerous command. Any local changes you made to that file are gone — Git just replaced that file with the last staged or committed version. Don’t ever use this command unless you absolutely know that you don’t want those unsaved local changes.
