### 3.5 Remote Branches
You can get a full list of remote references explicitly with git ls-remote \<remote>, or git remote show \<remote> for remote branches as well as more information.
To synchronize your work with a given remote, you run a git fetch \<remote> command (in our case, git fetch origin).

#### 3.5.1 Pushing
If you have a branch named serverfix that you want to work on with others, you can push it up the same way you pushed your first branch. 
Run git push \<remote> \<branch>:

    $ git push origin serverfix

To merge this work into your current working branch, you can run git merge origin/serverfix. 
If you want your own serverfix branch that you can work on, you can base it off your remotetracking branch:

    $ git checkout -b serverfix origin/serverfix

#### 3.5.2 Tracking Branches
If you’re on a tracking branch and type git pull, Git automatically knows which server to fetch from and which branch to merge in.
When you clone a repository, it generally automatically creates a master branch that tracks origin/master. 
However, you can set up other tracking branches if you wish — ones that track branches on other remotes, or don’t track the master branch. The simple case is the example you just saw, running git checkout -b \<branch> \<remote>/\<branch>. This is a common enough operation
that Git provides the --track shorthand:

    $ git checkout --track origin/serverfix

To set up a local branch with a different name than the remote branch, you can easily use the first version with a different local branch name:

    $ git checkout -b sf origin/serverfix
    Branch sf set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin. 
    Switched to a new branch 'sf'

Now, your local branch sf will automatically pull from origin/serverfix.

If you already have a local branch and want to set it to a remote branch you just pulled down, or want to change the upstream branch you’re tracking, you can use the -u or --set-upstream-to option to git branch to explicitly set it at any time.

    $ git branch -u origin/serverfix

If you want to see what tracking branches you have set up, you can use the -vv option to git branch.

    $ git branch -vv

If you want totally up to date ahead and behind numbers, you’ll need to fetch from all your remotes right before running this. You could do that like this:

    $ git fetch --all; git branch -vv

#### 3.5.3 Pulling
git pull will look up what server and branch your current branch is tracking, fetch from that server and then try to merge in that remote branch.
Generally it’s better to simply use the fetch and merge commands explicitly as the magic of git pull can often be confusing.

#### 3.5.4 Deleting Remote Branches
If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:

    $ git push origin --delete serverfix
