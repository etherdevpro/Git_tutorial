### 2.5. Working with Remotes
#### 2.5.1 Showing Your Remotes
To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command.

    $ git remote

You can also specify -v, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote:

    $ git remote -v

#### 2.5.2 Adding Remote Repositories
To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run git remote add \<shortname> \<url>:

    $ git remote add pro https://github.com/prodev/sampletask
    $ git remote -v
    origin https://github.com/prodev/sampletask (fetch)
    origin https://github.com/prodev/sampletask (push)
    pro https://github.com/prodev/sampletask (fetch)
    pro https://github.com/prodev/sampletask (push)

Now you can use the string pro on the command line instead of the whole URL.
For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Pro has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run git fetch pro:

    $ git fetch pro

#### 2.5.3 Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes
To get data from your remote projects, you can run:

    $ git fetch <remote>

If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch, you can use the git pull command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch.

    $ git pull

#### 2.5.4 Pushing to Your Remotes

When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: git push \<remote> \<branch>.

    $ git push origin master

#### 2.5.5 Inspecting a Remote

If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the git remote show \<remote> command.

    $ git remote show origin

#### 2.5.6 Renaming and Removing Remotes

You can run git remote rename to change a remote’s shortname. For instance, if you want to rename pro to dev, you can do so with git remote rename:

    $ git remote rename pro dev

You can either use git remote remove or git remote rm:

    $ git remote remove dev
