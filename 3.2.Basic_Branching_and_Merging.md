### 3.2 Basic Branching and Merging
#### 3.2.1 Basic Branching
To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:

    $ git checkout -b mybranch

This is shorthand for:
```
$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53
```
You work on your website and do some commits. Doing so moves the iss53 branch forward, because you have it checked out (that is, your HEAD is pointing to it):
```
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Create new footer [issue 53]'
```
For now, let’s assume you’ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your master branch:

    $ git checkout master

Next, you have a hotfix to make. Let’s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it’s completed:
```
$ git checkout -b hotfix
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Fix broken email address'
[hotfix 1fb7853] Fix broken email address
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

You can run your tests, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and finally merge the hotfix branch back into your master branch to deploy to production. You do this with the git merge command:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix
Updating f42c576..3a0874c
Fast-forward
index.html | 2 ++
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```
You can delete it with the -d option to git branch:

    $ git branch -d hotfix
