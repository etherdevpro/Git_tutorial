### 3.2 Basic Branching and Merging
#### 3.2.1 Basic Branching
To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:

    $ git checkout -b mybranch

This is shorthand for:
```
$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53
```
You work on your website and do some commits. Doing so moves the iss53 branch forward, because you have it checked out (that is, your HEAD is pointing to it):
```
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Create new footer [issue 53]'
```
For now, let’s assume you’ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your master branch:

    $ git checkout master

Next, you have a hotfix to make. Let’s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it’s completed:
```
$ git checkout -b hotfix
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'Fix broken email address'
[hotfix 1fb7853] Fix broken email address
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```

You can run your tests, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and finally merge the hotfix branch back into your master branch to deploy to production. You do this with the git merge command:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix
Updating f42c576..3a0874c
Fast-forward
index.html | 2 ++
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)
```
You can delete it with the -d option to git branch:

    $ git branch -d hotfix

#### 3.2.2 Basic Merginig
Suppose you’ve decided that your issue #53 work is complete and ready to be merged into your master branch. In order to do that, you’ll merge your iss53 branch into master, much like you
merged your hotfix branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the git merge command:
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge iss53
```
#### 3.2.3 Basic Merge Conflicts
Occasionally, this process doesn’t go smoothly. If you changed the same part of the same file differently in the two branches you’re merging, Git won’t be able to merge them cleanly.
Git hasn’t automatically created a new merge commit. It has paused the process while you resolve the conflict. If you want to see which files are unmerged at any point after a merge conflict, you can run git status:
```
$ git status
On branch master
You have unmerged paths.
(fix conflicts and run "git commit")
Unmerged paths:
(use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
both modified: index.html
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself.
After you’ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run git add on each file to mark it as resolved. Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.
If you want to use a graphical tool to resolve these issues, you can run git mergetool, which fires up an appropriate visual merge tool and walks you through the conflicts:

    $ git mergetool
