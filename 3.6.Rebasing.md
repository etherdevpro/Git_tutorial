### 3.6. Rebasing
In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the merge and the rebase.

#### 3.6.1 The Basic Rebase
you would check out the experiment branch, and then rebase it onto the master branch as follows:
```
$ git checkout experiment
$ git rebase master
```
At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge experiment
```
#### 3.6.2 More Interesting Rebases
Suppose you decide that you want to merge your client-side changes into your mainline for a release, 
but you want to hold off on the server-side changes until it’s tested further. 
You can take the changes on client that aren’t on server and replay them on your master branch by using the --onto option of git rebase: 

    $ git rebase --onto master server client

This basically says, “Take the client branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the server branch, and replay these patches in the client branch as if it was based directly off the master branch instead.” It’s a bit complex, but the result is pretty cool.

Now you can fast-forward your master branch.
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge client
```
Let’s say you decide to pull in your server branch as well. You can rebase the server branch onto the master branch without having to check it out first by running git rebase \<basebranch> \<topicbranch> — which checks out the topic branch (in this case, server) for you and replays it onto the base branch (master):

    $ git rebase master server

This replays your server work on top of your master work, as shown in Rebasing your server branch on top of your master branch.
Then, you can fast-forward the base branch (master):
```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge server
```
